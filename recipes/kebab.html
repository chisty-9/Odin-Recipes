    <img src="./images/Chapli_Kebab.jpeg" alt="Chapli_Kebab">
    <h3>Chapli kebab is a spicy, flavorful minced meat patty originating from South Asia, especially popular in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Made with ground beef or lamb, itâ€™s seasoned with spices like coriander, cumin, and chilies, and mixed with onions and tomatoes for extra juiciness. Shaped into flat, round patties, chapli kebabs are shallow-fried until golden and crispy. They are often served with naan, chutneys, or salad, making for a deliciously hearty dish.</h3>
    <h3><p>The juicy richness of chapli kebab complements the smoky essence of grilled dishes, making it a versatile favorite. Its crispy edges and tender interior provide a delightful contrast of textures, perfect for pairing with fresh salads or warm flatbreads.</p></h3>
