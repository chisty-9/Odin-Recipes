    <h3>Paratha is a flaky, layered flatbread that is a staple in South Asian cuisine, particularly enjoyed in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Made from whole wheat flour, the dough is rolled out, layered with ghee or oil, folded, and rolled again to create its characteristic layers. Cooked on a hot griddle, parathas turn golden and crispy while remaining soft inside. They are versatile and can be served plain or stuffed with fillings like potatoes, paneer, or lentils, making them a perfect accompaniment to curries or a delicious standalone dish.</h3>
